    <h2>What is this web about?</h2>
    <p>In this website you will be able to learn how to use some applications of 3D software and also how to create your own designs for then printing them out and give them the use you want.</p>

  <div id="1. What is 3D printing?">
    <h2>1. What is 3D printing?</h2>
    <p>3D printing consists on printing out 3D digital models by melting materials in a certain way that the machine then puts it forming your moddel while this materials solidify.</p>
    <h2>1.1 What it is used for?</h2>
    <p>It is used in many different ways. Some people uses it just to print their own models or from other people, and oter use them in industries, architecture and more.</p>
    <h2>1.2 What materials are used?</h2>
    <p>In 3d printing there is a variety of materials you can use depending on what it is going to be printed. For example, if you are going to print something just for you, you may use PLA or plastic; if you are going to work on planes, cars or similar, you shall print it with metal; and if you are an architect and tou are going to print a house, you can use concrete. 
  </div>
  <div id="2. Software used">
    <h1>2. Software used</h1>
<p>In this part you are going to learn of some applications in which you can design your own models for 3D printing. The majority of them are free, but some you have to pay for their use. Most of this are easy to handle, but you need to know the basis of the program.</p>
    <h2>2.1 Blender</h2>
    <p>Blender is a free software used for 3D disign but also for animations, sculpting and video edition. It is simple to use, but if you want to do a specific thing you might look for some tutorials and learn from them.</p>

    <h2>2.2 FreeCAD</h2>
    <p>FreeCAD is a very good software for designing your parts. It is used for the design of more complex pieces as can be the parts of a motor or other things. In this application you can play with default geometric parts and modify them as you please, or you can design your part in 2D and then extrude it to have a 3D form.</p>

    <h2>2.3 TinkerCAD</h2>
    <p>Tinkercad is a free web where you can create your own models and share them with other people. This one, in my opinion is the simplest to use. You have default geometric forms and you modify them in very simple ways. If you know anything about 3D printing, it is a good point to start.</p>

    <h2>2.4 OpenSCAD</h2>
    <p>It is a free software for designing 3D models. It is a script-only based modeller that uses its own description language; parts can be previewed, but cannot be interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view. An OpenSCAD script specifies geometric primitives (such as spheres, boxes, cylinders, etc.) and defines how they are modified and combined (for instance by intersection, difference and envelope combination) to render a 3D model.</p>

   <div id="3. What to do when you finished designing your model?">
     <h1>3. What to do when you finished designing your model?</h1>
     <p>When you finished designing your 3D model, you have to export the file to the format stl(Standard Triangle Language). When you have done that, you have to open a program that transforms your file to gcode which is the form in which the 3D printer is going to read the fila and then print it. There are a lot of programs that do this. Some examples are: Slic3r,Make Printable, etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="4.3D printers">
    <h1>4. 3D printers</h1>
    <p>3D printers are machines that prints out a figure from the file you gave it.</p>
    
    <h2>4.1 Types of 3D printers</h2>
    <p>There are maby types of 3D printers, but the most common ones are the ones that use PLA or derivates, and the ones of resin.</p>
